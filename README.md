# CJ Affiliate Tag for Google Tag Manager (server-side)

The CJ Affiliate Tag allows advertisers to store a server-side cookie for CJ's click ID and send a conversion event (S2S) to CJ Affiliate.

## How does the Addingwell tag work?

This template is a tag that reads the standard event schema thatâ€™s sent from the client running on a tagging server. It then converts the conversion event to the appropriate schema and sends it through CJ API.

CJ Affiliate Tag tracks two event types:
- Pageview event reads the CJ's click ID parameter from the URL (cjevent) and stores it on a server-side cookie named cje.
- Conversion event sends the conversion to CJ Affiliate.

The tag supports only GA4 client.
